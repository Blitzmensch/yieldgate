              The moment users stake, they receive a climate action badge, enabling them to prove
              their participation, including their relative contribution to carbon credits removed,
              using Stake For Earth. When they remove their stake, their badge becomes inactive.
              This creates the incentive for anyone to continue staking and make a perpetual impact.
              Stakers can both decide to make a permanent pledge or a withdrawable pledge. The
              difference being that the permanent pledge will continue to both generate yield and
              buy up carbon tokens in perpetuity.
